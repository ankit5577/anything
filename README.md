Executive Summary <sub>(opening ≈ 30 sec)</sub>

    “Good morning Chairperson [Name], distinguished board members, and respected colleagues. I’m [Your Name], newly inducted into SBI, and it’s my privilege to present how we will deepen SBI’s leadership in UPI, digital lending, and robo-advisory.
    India processed a record 18.68 billion UPI payments worth ₹25.14 lakh crore in May 2025—and SBI already captures one-fifth of that value. Our digital loan book crossed ₹2.43 lakh crore and our YONO platform now serves 7.8 crore customers. Today I’ll lay out the five-year roadmap that converts this scale into sustained profit growth while meeting the RBI’s tighter 2025 digital-lending norms.”

Slide 1 – Title <sub>(15 sec)</sub>

    “The theme—Strategic FinTech Innovations at SBI: UPI, Digital Lending & Robo-Advisory Roadmap (FY 2025-30)—signals that technology is no longer a support function; it is the core engine of margin expansion and market relevance.”

Slide 2 – Agenda <sub>(20 sec)</sub>

    “We’ll examine the market landscape, celebrate recent wins, isolate the growth drivers, share the integrated tech architecture, and finally request board approval for Phase-1 funding.”

Slide 3 – India FinTech Landscape <sub>(1 min)</sub>

    UPI scale: May 2025 volumes up 4.4 % MoM to 18.68 billion transactions; value up to ₹25.14 lakh crore.

    “The headline is simple: digital payments have tipped from ‘growth story’ to ‘national utility’. Any institution slow to harness that flow risks irrelevance.”

Slide 4 – SBI & UPI Dominance <sub>(1 min)</sub>

(Insert bar / doughnut chart here)

    SBI commands ≈ 22 % share of UPI value, translating to ₹172 crore in monthly fee income and a 33 % YoY jump in volumes.

    The share is strategic because it boosts CASA balances and lowers cost of funds by ≈ 30 bp.

    “Every incremental 1 % share in UPI adds roughly ₹7,000 crore of low-cost float to our treasury. That is the cheapest form of capital in today’s market.”

Slide 5 – Digital Lending @ SBI Today <sub>(1 min)</sub>

    Digital loan book: ₹2.43 lakh crore—18 % of total advances.

    Turn-around time: 24× faster via e-KYC, cutting acquisition cost ₹860 / loan.

    Straight-through processing: 98 % STP drives 42 % lower ops cost and NPAs 120 bp below traditional channels.

    Recent momentum: YONO disbursed ₹1,399 crore of pre-approved personal loans in Q1 FY25 alone.

    Digital channels earn 240 – 320 bp higher NIM and diversify credit risk by ≈ 18 %.

    ROI on compliance investments: 235 % pay-back in ≈ 5 months.
