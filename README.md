### Executive Summary (opening ≈ 30 sec)

    “Good morning Chairperson [Name], distinguished board members, and respected colleagues. I’m [Your Name], newly inducted into SBI, and it’s my privilege to present how we will deepen SBI’s leadership in UPI, digital lending, and robo-advisory. India processed a record 18.68 billion UPI payments worth ₹25.14 lakh crore in May 2025—and SBI already captures one-fifth of that value. Our digital loan book crossed ₹2.43 lakh crore and our YONO platform now serves 7.8 crore customers. Today I’ll lay out the five-year roadmap that converts this scale into sustained profit growth while meeting the RBI’s tighter 2025 digital-lending norms.”

### Slide 1 – Title (15 sec)

    “The theme—Strategic FinTech Innovations at SBI: UPI, Digital Lending & Robo-Advisory Roadmap (FY 2025-30)—signals that technology is no longer a support function; it is the core engine of margin expansion and market relevance.”

### Slide 2 – Agenda (20 sec)

    “We’ll examine the market landscape, celebrate recent wins, isolate the growth drivers, share the integrated tech architecture, and finally request board approval for Phase-1 funding.”

### Slide 3 – India FinTech Landscape (1 min)

Key points to emphasise

    UPI scale: May 2025 volumes up 4.4 % MoM to 18.68 billion txns; value up to ₹25.14 lakh crore.

    m.economictimes.com

    Bank participation: 673 banks live on UPI, up from 602 a year ago, reinforcing network effects.
    npci.org.in

    Competitive dynamics: PhonePe & Google Pay still dominate front-end apps, but SBI is the largest bank-originator by value—a strategic lever for float and fee income.

    “The headline is simple: digital payments have tipped from ‘growth story’ to ‘national utility’. Any institution slow to harness that flow risks irrelevance.”

Slide 4 – SBI & UPI Dominance (1 min)

Use your bar/doughnut chart here.

    SBI commands ~22 % share of UPI value, translating to ₹172 crore in monthly fee income and a 33 % YoY jump in volumes. 

    The share is strategic because it boosts CASA balances and lowers cost of funds by ~30 bp.
    timesofindia.indiatimes.com

    “Every incremental 1 % share in UPI adds roughly ₹7 000 crore of low-cost float to our treasury. That is the cheapest form of capital in today’s market.”

Slide 5 – Digital Lending @ SBI Today (1 min)

    Digital loan book: ₹2.43 lakh crore—18 % of total advances. 

Turn-around time: 24× faster via e-KYC, cutting acquisition cost ₹860/loan.

Straight-through processing: 98 % STP drives 42 % lower ops cost and NPAs 120 bp below traditional channels.

    Recent momentum: YONO disbursed ₹1 399 crore of pre-approved personal loans in Q1 FY25 alone.

    “The data prove that digitisation is not merely customer-friendly; it is shareholder-friendly.”

Slide 6 – Market Tailwinds (1 min)

    India’s consumer-lending market will reach US $724 billion in 2025 and grow 4.9 % CAGR through 2028.

    Digital channels earn 240–320 bp higher NIM and diversify credit risk by ~18 %. 

    “Put differently, for every ₹100 we migrate to digital origination, we harvest up to ₹3.20 extra in net interest while reducing concentration risk.”

Slide 7 – Compliance Edge (1 min)

    RBI’s May 10 2025 master directions sharpen rules on transparency, data privacy and default-loss guarantees.

    SBI’s digital-lending framework already aligns with 2024 DLG FAQs, giving us a five-month lead on many NBFC-fintech peers.

    ROI on compliance investments: 235 % pay-back in ≈ 5 months. 

    “Regulation is often viewed as friction; we treat it as competitive moats that lower systemic risk and raise the bar for new entrants.”

Slide 8 – Robo-Advisory Opportunity (1 min)

    India’s robo-advisory AUM will hit US $19.8 billion in 2024; users forecast at 3.2 million by 2028.

    “Millennial and Gen-Z investors like advice, dislike paperwork, and distrust opacity—exactly what algorithmic advisory solves.”

Slide 9 – Proposed SBI Robo-Advisory (1 min)

    “Our solution embeds goal-based investing, ESG filters, tax harvesting, and micro-SIP automation directly into YONO Wealth, leveraging the existing 7.8 crore user base.”

    Hybrid model: algorithmic portfolios with human-advisor override for high-net-worth clients.

    Expected fee income: ₹1 050 crore by FY28 on conservative 1 % AUM yield.

Slide 10 – Integrated FinTech Architecture (1 min)

    “This diagram shows UPI rails feeding real-time behavioural data into our Digital Lending Engine, which in turn supplies risk-weighted insights to the Robo-Advisory layer. A unified data lake and AI decision tier sit at the core, ensuring compliance logging and model auditability.”

Key tech choices: ISO 20022 messaging, multi-cloud resiliency on OCI/AWS, and RBI-compliant secure API gateways.
